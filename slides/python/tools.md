## Using Python to Work with Data

The __first part of this semester__ will focus on:

1. {:.fragment} intermediate Python skillz
2. {:.fragment} using Python to:
	* {:.fragment} read / retrieve and clean data
	* {:.fragment} analyze and / or visualize data

All of this <span class="hl">without a database or SQL</span> (at least not yet!).
{:.fragment}

(we'll get to that in a month or so)

## Why Python?

There <span class="hl">so many languages for scientific / numeric computing and working with data</span>... &rarr;

* {:.fragment} [Julia](https://julialang.org/)
* {:.fragment} [R](https://www.r-project.org)
* {:.fragment} [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)

__❓🐍 over these other languages?__

## Why Python Continued...

* {:.fragment} it's _really_ popular ([like top 3 popular](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) 📈
* {:.fragment} has a [thriving data science / engineering community] (https://pydata.org/) 🤓🤓🤓
* {:.fragment} `pandas`, `jupyter-notebook`, etc. are pretty standard tools to use in your data stack 🐼
* {:.fragment} it's a general purpose language that's been widely adopted in other domains, like web applications, dev ops, etc.
* {:.fragment} you probably know basic python already (more time to focus on data related topics) 🔬
* {:.fragment} oh, and I actually _know_ Python a little bit; at least enough to teach it! 🙃
