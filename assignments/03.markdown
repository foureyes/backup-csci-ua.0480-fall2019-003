# Assignment #3 - Cleaning and Preparing Data - Due Mon, Oct 8th  at 11pm

In this assignment, you'll create two notebooks (`ipynb`) that contain documentation and code for the following.

1. find a data set that you're interested in from a _reputable_ source 
	* describe the data set
	* come up with some questions that this data may help answer
2. clean/prepare/transform the data
3. calculate some descriptive statistics and use your data to answer the questions that you documented earlier
4. export and validate calculations
	* export a csv
	* ...then import the csv into a spreadsheet 
	* confirm that your descriptive statistics match
	* save or export the spreadsheet as an Open Office (`.ods`) or Excel File (`.xls`)
5. create a second notebook and repeat steps 2 and 3
	* if you used `pandas` previously, do this in regular python
	* if you didn't use `pandas` previously, use `pandas`

For extra credit, choose two of the following:

1. incorporate the use of a class, generator or decorator in a meaningful way
2. tackle pagination
3. work with a medium / _larger_ data set (> 5,000 records)


## Part 1 - Selecting and Documenting a Data Set

#### Find a data set that you'd like to work with

Find a data set that's meaningful to you from a source that has some information regarding the provenance of the data (_where did it come from!?_). Check out some [sources here](../data-sets.html). Some guidelines:

1. <span class="hl">don't use the dog bites data set</span> (or _really_, any other data set that we've used in class, because, uh... we already cleaned it üôÅ)
2. (for the next part) write <span class="hl">code that's different from the programs that we've done in class</span> (it's not adequate to simply use class sample code with a different data set üôÖ)

#### Write some documentation and start a notebook called `homework02a.ipynb`:

1. In a markdown cell, describe the data that you've selected
	* link to any documentation about the data that you've found 
	* discuss the origin of the data (what is it, who collected / generated it, how did they do it, etc.)
	* describe why you are interested in it 
	* list a few (2 ~ 3)  questions that you think this data set may answer
2. Using code, show a small part of the data
	* you can download the data beforehand and read it from a file
	* ...or you can retrieve the data from the web
	* display a substring (perhaps the first 200 or 300 characters)
3. Document the format of the data in a markdown cell
	* describe the fields / column headers 
	* determine the _likely_ data type (you can use regular python types or numpy types) of each field
4. Describe the problems (or potential transformations) that are present in the data and the process you'll use to clean / prepare it 
	* keep this high-level (you don't have to mention specific tools / code)
	* assume that your goal is to clean up the data so that you can calculate some descriptive statistics about it
	* ...and answer some of the questions that you've asked

## Part 2 - Clean or Prepare the Data

1. Using the documentation that you wrote earlier in your notebook, write code to clean up and/or prepare your data
2. üôÖAgain, don't copy our previous in-class programs to do this
3. You can do this in regular Python (including any built-in modules, like `csv`) or `pandas` (you'll do it again with or without pandas in the last part)
4. Comment your code or add markdown cells as you proceed
5. Periodically show rows / subsets of the data (keep these data samples short so as not to make the notebook unnecessarily long) as you work through your data

## Part 3 - Stats and Answers

1. Use your newly clean data to calculate some descriptive statistics on some columns (outliers with min and max for a column, mean, median, etc.)
2. In a mix of markdown cells and code, try to run some simple analysis to answer your questions that you came up with earlier in your notebook

## Part 4 - Export Your Data

1. Export your data as a `csv` - you can use `pandas` or regular Python (with any built-in modules, even `csv`) to do this 
2. Open the data in a spreadsheet
	* use Excel, Open Office, Google Sheets, etc.
3. Calculate the same descriptive statistics that you did in your code, but do so in your spreadsheet 
	* for example `MEDIAN`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, etc.
4. Compare your results with your calculate results in your notebook
5. If they do not match...
	* try to debug your code
	* if you can't make the results match, describe the inconsistencies in a markdown cell

## Part 5 - Do it Again

1. Repeat parts 2 and 3 in a notebook called `homework02b.ipynb`
2. However, if you used `pandas` previously, use regular Python (or the other way around)
3. If you find that this is not possible, keep your work intact, 
4. In a markdown cell, describe the challenges that you encountered or compare and contrast your approach with the way that you did it previously
